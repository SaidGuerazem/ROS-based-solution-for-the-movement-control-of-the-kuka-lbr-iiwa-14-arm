# A ROS Based Solution for the Movement Control of the KUKA lbr iiwa 14 manipulator arm

**Description**
During my internship at CDTA, we used the ROS API developed by  Sheffield robotics to control the kuka lbr iiwa 14 arm. Furthermore, we could introduce a simple trajectory illustrator and recreate it using a High level controller that uses rosbag and the API for the trajectory immitation.
